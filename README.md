## Birds eye view for enhanced spatial awareness for human operator while tele-operating Gropher robot

<i> Part of Directed Research RBE 595 under Prof. Jane Li at Worcester Polytechnic Institute </i>

### Testing Phase & Motive

Gropher is a nursing robot design to carry out dexterous nursing tasks in a hospital environment. 

Research study on its human interaction is being pursued by PhD candidate Joey at WPI, Worcester, MA, USA, the simulations of which are designed and built in the Unity environment.

The simulation study essentially consists of a busy hospital floor with humans beings regularly walking around along with many static and dynamics objects placed on the floor.

Gropher performs non-operative nursing tasks such sanitizing, reading QR codes, picking up medicines etc and the simulation is designed to conduct these tasks sequentially.  

Upon relentless tests carried on the Gropher robot, instances were found where Human-Robot-Interaction could be leveraged in order to increase robot / task efficacies. 

For instance bottle neck spaces created by static or dynamic objects created problems for the navigation stack of the robot to negotiate.

There were instances where the robot crashed into objects, or could not figure out a local path to circumvent the obstacle. 

My team and I are responsible for building human robot interaction tool in order to streamline the task performance by leveraging everything a human is better at. 

So instead of improving the autonomous stack of the robot, we focus on tele-operating and human robot interface to help teleoperators take over the robot when necessary.

### The Issue With Teleoperation & The Birds Eye View 

During the tests, it was discovered that the existing interface wasn't providing with sufficient data / views in order for a teleoperator to operate the robot for navigation tasks. Because of this, the robot regularly hit walls, static and dynamic objects while being operate by a human. To increase spatial awareness, we build an interface that displays top down 360 degree view generated by transforming images from camera feed.  

This repository implements building a 360 degree birds-eye-view around the Gropher robot.
